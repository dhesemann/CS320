# How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
Test extensively. Try not to get hacked. Security training
I can ensure my code is functional by testing extensively.  Test cases should test that the program behaves as expected when being used properly, and also that it behaves as expected when used incorrectly, for example if a user enters invalid input.  Testing can also help to keep code secure by identifying vulnerabilities in the code.	

# How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
Collecting requirements from users is an important aspect of requirements determination.  Understanding the different types of users a program will have and how each type of user will use the program is the first step to identifying the specific tasks and functions that the program needs to perform.  The requirements can be incorporated into the program by planning out different classes for various users or entities and keeping track of what information will need to be stored for each and what functions use them.

# How do I approach designing software?
The first step to designing software is understanding the wants and needs of a user and/or customer and to plan how to incorporate them into the program.  It is helpful to use documentation methods like design documents or diagrams to plan out the workings of the system, user activity, what classes are necessary, and so on.  Itâ€™s also important to plan test cases for the requirements to ensure the various requirements are met.  Then the code can be written, tested, and adjusted until it ready to be deployed.
